# Loan Eligibility Prediction

This is my first Data Science application project to predict loan eligibility using decision tree and logistic regression models. 
The project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook and uses the `scikit-learn` library for model building. 



## Introduction

The goal of this project is to build a predictive model to determine the eligibility of loan applicants based on their information. 
This can help financial institutions streamline their loan approval process.

## Features

- Predict loan eligibility using decision tree and logistic regression models.
- Analyze and visualize data to understand key factors affecting loan approval.
- Provide a step-by-step guide on data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Data Description
The dataset is taken from kaggle(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vikasukani/loan-eligible-dataset) which includes test data and sample data for each customer.
The dataset contains information about loan applicants and whether their loans were approved or not. Below is a description of each feature:
